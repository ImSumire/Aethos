From scorching deserts to twisted forests of bone, each biome presents its own unique challenges, testing the mettle of those who dare to traverse its treacherous expanses. Amidst the inferno, the imposing structures of Apocalyptic Fortress loom ominously, their dark spires serving as bastions of danger and untold secrets. <br><br>Within these formidable strongholds, lurking amongst the shadows, are the sinister denizens unleashed by "Creatures and Beasts" and "Alex's Mobs" their otherworldly forms and relentless aggression adding an additional layer of dread to an already perilous landscape. As adventurers delve deeper into the abyssal depths of the Nether, they must steel themselves against the onslaught of infernal foes and navigate the ever-shifting landscapes, for only the bravest and most resourceful will emerge victorious from the crucible of the Nether's depths. <img src="assets/images/nether.webp"> <h2>The End</h2> In the mysterious realm of The End, adventurers are greeted by a breathtaking array of biomes, each a testament to the boundless creativity of "Oh The Biomes You'll Go." From ethereal forests to desolate wastelands, these biomes offer diverse ecosystems, themes, and ambiances, inviting exploration and discovery. Amidst this otherworldly landscape, creatures from "Creatures and Beasts" and "Alex's Mobs" lurk in the shadows, their presence adding an air of both wonder and danger to the End's enigmatic expanse. As explorers venture further, they may stumble upon the enigmatic dungeons spawned by "When Dungeons Arise" each holding its own secrets and challenges to overcome. <br><br> Yet, beyond the familiar confines of the End, lies the "Upper End" a realm far removed from the regular end asteroids, boasting its own biomes and exotic materials waiting to be unearthed. Here, the boundaries of possibility are stretched even further, with new crops flourishing uniquely from their vanilla counterparts, offering bountiful harvests to those daring enough to cultivate them. However, travelers must remain vigilant, as the skies above may darken with "Ooze Rain" a new weather event that brings its own perils to those who dare to tread its path. <br><br> Enhancing the End's allure are upgrades to its very essence, with new stone, ores, foliage, and a mysterious new liquid reshaping its landscape. Decorative blocks abound, adding splendor to the otherwise stark surroundings, while new music tracks serenade adventurers as they navigate the End's ever-shifting terrain. Yet, this overhaul is not merely cosmetic; nearly every aspect of the mod introduces unique mechanics, ensuring that the End remains a realm of intrigue and challenge. <br><br> With custom sounds, ambient particles, and immersive details, the End is transformed into a realm of unparalleled wonder and danger, beckoning adventurers to unravel its mysteries and forge their own destiny amidst its infinite possibilities. <img src="assets/images/end2.webp"> <img src="assets/images/end1.webp"> <h2>Everbright & Everdawn</h2> Find the Gatekeeper and trade a book in exchange for his journal. You can find the houses spawning in either plains, mountains, and most snowy biomes. The Gatekeeper has extensive knowledge on these dimensions and has written all about the blocks, mobs, and dungeons found within to help guide you on your journey. You can also trade for a Zeal Lighter that works on both the Everbright and Everdawn portal frames. Check around their home as they have an unlit portal frame somewhere. As you progress through the mod, other trades may become available, so it's worth checking his offers after reaching certain milestones. <img src="assets/images/gatekeeper.webp"> Once you have found the Gatekeeper, be sure to trade emeralds for the Zeal Lighter to be able to light one of the portal frames. He keeps an unlit Everbright or Everdawn portal stored somewhere in his home that you can use. Once you find the portal, tidy it up, give it a light, and it should open a door to its respective dimension. <br><br> The Blue Journal, a book written by the Gatekeeper that's filled with information discovered from his experiences in these dimensions. The more you progress through Blue Skies, the more pages you will unlock in the journal. You only need to obtain the blue journal item once. Afterwards, you can always find access to it by opening your inventory and clicking the tab on the right with the blue journal icon. <br><br> The Everbright is a realm of eternal day and frigid cold. Home to large beasts and ethereal mobs, you'll need to keep an eye on your back as you traverse through this world. Be sure to watch out for snow storms that bring thick fog and more enemies than usual. As you explore, you'll encounter the Summoner's Blinding Dungeon and the new Nature Dungeon, home of the Starlit Crusher. <img src="assets/images/everbright.webp"> The Everdawn has its sun forever rising. With this being a much more humid and warm world, insects and reptiles flourish. Before entering, it's worth preparing for poison and fire as many parts of this world may inflict those on you. Venture across this diverse landscape to uncover the Alchemist's Blinding Dungeon and then the new Poison Dungeon, lair of the Arachnarch. <img src="assets/images/everdawn.webp"> Blue Skies is home to various bosses found within their respective dungeons. These bosses are designed for players looking for a challenge, so be sure to come prepared. If you find a dungeon that has already been conquered, attempting to activate the keystone will unlock trades with the Gatekeeper, allowing you to purchase the needed keys. <br><br> The bosses have been designed with multiplayer in mind, scaling up in difficulty with more players. Grab your friends and open the door to an epic battle! <br><br> Once you've defeated a boss, you may respawn it with the arc item obtained from it by using the arc on the keystone. Doing so will spawn the boss at a higher difficulty, which may result in better loot. <br><br> <u>The Summoner and the Alchemist, rulers of the towers of both dimensions!</u><br> The two Blinding Dungeons found between both dimensions are home to the Summoner and the Alchemist. These bosses were balanced with mid-tier armor and weapons in mind, allowing for an early combat experience should you accept the challenge. <br><br> Residing in the Everbright, the Summoner fights with lightning, energy attacks, and his golem guards. Be sure to watch your back as these golems can quickly overwhelm you if not properly tended to. Defeating him will allow you to access the Nature Dungeon. <br><br> Found in the Everdawn, the Alchemist uses potions and physical constructs to fight. Many of his attacks can be predicted by looking out for visual queues, but missing those queues may result in heavy damage. Once defeated, you'll gain access to the Poison Dungeon. <img src="assets/images/towers.webp"> <u>Meet the Starlit Crusher, the boss of the Nature Dungeon!</u><br> The Nature Dungeon is a massive labyrinth consisting of 4 floors. Each floor contains one of the required keys and a staircase up to the next floor. Be sure to check every nook and cranny and to not be overrun by the Stonlets living within. <br><br> Resting at the top of the Nature Dungeon, you'll be met face to face with the Starlit Crusher. This sentient tree may not move much, but makes up for it by rooting into the ground to produce wide area attacks from below and enough brutal strength to cause the ground itself to shake. Seeing as it's still a tree, axes deal far more damage against it and are required to bypass its defenses. Look out for opportunities to stun it with a spear for an opening to attack. <img src="assets/images/labyrinth.webp"> <u>The Arachnarch, the boss of the Poison Dungeon!</u><br> The Poison Dungeon is a large maze buried beneath the surface. On the surface, you'll find a large, hollowed, maple tree covered in cobwebs. Made of 4 floors, you'll need to find the key on each one and then descend to the next. Be sure not to lose your way in the spiders' nest. <br><br> Lurking in the lowest depths of the Poison Dungeon, you'll find the Arachnarch in her lair. This venomous foe lunges at targets and sprays poison from the ceiling above. Being the queen of this nest, expect reinforcements to come crawling from the walls. With such an aggressive method of attacking, you may be able to stun her when she lunges by blocking with your shield. <img src="assets/images/poison.webp"> <h2>The Aether</h2> To get started with the Aether, you must construct a portal with a Glowstone frame and light it with a water bucket in the middle, this will activate the portal and allow you to step through and enter the dimension. From here you can begin your survival in the Aether's hostile paradise! The Aether's world contains three new mysterious dungeons, each with a fearsome boss to defeat... <img src="assets/images/portal.webp"> The Bronze Dungeon is the home of the Sentries and guarded by the ominous Slider, a creature born of pure stone. Look out for hidden tunnels through islands and prepare yourself with the best gear you can craft! <br><br> The Silver Dungeon is the beautiful Valkyrie Temple. Challenge the knights of the Valkyrie Order and, if you prove worthy, fight the Valkyrie Queen herself. Utilize every tool and trick you can to best this ancient warrior. <br><br> Within the rare Gold Dungeon lies the Sun Spirit, an eternal being of pure fire and energy. He is the God that rules the very Sun itself and will take some convincing to even pay attention to a being such as yourself. But it is rumored he guards some of the best treasure that exists in the Aether. <img src="assets/images/aether.webp"> <h2>The Twilight Forest</h2> To get started in the mod, you first need to create a portal to access the Twilight Forest, after doing so you're ready to explore! <br><br>The portal can be assembles in any shape and size you want, the image above is just the minimum size requirement and the portal can be made in many different shapes and sizes. The portal functions as long as the following conditions are met: <ul> <li>The frame is made out of Grass, Dirt, Podzol, Mycelium, etc.</li> <li> On top of the grass are flowers, mushrooms, leaves, plants, etc. </li> <li>The frame must be completely filled with water.</li> </ul> <img src="assets/images/twilight.webp"> </section> </main>  <script src="src/main.min.js"></script>
