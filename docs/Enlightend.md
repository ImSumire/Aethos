Enlightend is a mod enhancing the ends feel while also preserving its intended style. It expands on the desolate nature of the end while adding new biomes scattered few and far between the end islands. <br /><br /> The mod also adds more exploration below and above the end islands. Travelling upwards in the End will lead you into the Upper End, which is like a massive asteroid belt far out from the end islands acting as an opposite to overworld caves, featuring its own distinct biomes, blocks, and items. Similarly you can also travel downwards too, and find the radioactive Enderneath or other rare materials to use. Just be weary of the threats in the end, whether it be biological or inorganic, after-all, you're in unknown territories.
