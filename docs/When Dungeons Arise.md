When Dungeons Arise is a massive dungeon generator which gathers plenty of dungeons and generates them randomly on your worlds to ensure glorious adventures and challenges. We have took a step away from standard vanilla structures, resulting in imposing dungeons to lose yourself into.<br /><br />However, be wary when you venture into a palace in search of precious loot, and don't forget to land safely after raiding a hostile airship. Dungeons will generate foes to keep you away from them... at least until you're ready to walk across countless, dangerous passages...
