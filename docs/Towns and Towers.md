Towns & Towers is a mod that aims to expand upon the 1.14 update created by Mojang with new villages, pillager outposts, and even brand-new ships. The structures themselves are a bit more detailed than their vanilla counterparts, but they still fit seamlessly into the world. Not only that but many are inspired by real-life buildings or architectural styles, giving them a fresh new feel. There are over 50 structures added by Towns and Towers so far (as of update 1.9), so have fun exploring! And remember, it’s not the destination that’s important, but the journey to get there.
